# Foundation Models Demo

This repo is the code accompanying a talk I gave at the [Seoul iOS Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/seoul-ios-meetup/) on July 24, 2025.
All information was accurate at the time, but may not reflect the state of the frameworks in the future.
The code in this repo is provided as a snapshot in time will probably not receive ongoing updates.

## Quickstart

You will need the following to run this demo code:

* Xcode 26
* An iOS device running iOS 26 (NB: you must have Apple Intelligence enabled and the language + region set to US English at the time of this writing)
* A Mac running the latest version of Sonoma OR the Tahoe beta

To run the tools demo, you'll also need a free [Stadia Maps API key](https://docs.stadiamaps.com/authentication/#generating-and-revoking-api-keys).
